## Today Lesson

learned about a few hooks and build one project on counter just basic if click on one button it changes the counter in multiple places

# React usecase
 
React best use case was that when first discovered was that we can change multiple items in one click instead if getting elements by id or class and changes it's text we can just use **Hook** 
With the help of hook we use state and change the counter 

# useState Hook

`
let [counter , setCounter] = useState(initial value)
`

every name in the hook is the placeholder we can give any name to it 
first value is the variable and it has the initial value given here

`
counter = initial value
`

and setCounter is the method that changes the variable

initial value can be any value like array , boolean (True / False) , Object , Constant value or even Function.
